## 2. Learning How to Learn

### Question 2  
### What was the most interesting story or idea for you.
The Most interesting stories for me from the video were about Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison.
Especially Dali's way of solving problem. When he was stuck with a painting he would sit in chair with keys in his hands and relax until he falls asleep. When the keys dropped, the sound would wake him up and his brain gets active again to solve the problem. 



### Question 3  
### What are active and diffused mode of thinking?
Active mode of thinking is when we are fully focused and concentrated.
Diffused mode of thinking is when brain is relaxed but still working in background.
When Dali relaxed and almost fell asleep, he entered diffused mode.
The moment he woke up, his brain mixed diffused + active mode, which helped him get creative ideas.
