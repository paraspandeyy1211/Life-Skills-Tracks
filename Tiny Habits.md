**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me was BJ Fogg’s story about building the push-up habit. He did only two push-ups after brushing his teeth. It was very simple. I learned that small habits can grow into big change.

## Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP means:

- Motivation  
- Ability  
- Prompt  

A habit starts when we have these three things. For example, I want to read more. I will read one page after dinner. One page is easy, and dinner is my prompt.
